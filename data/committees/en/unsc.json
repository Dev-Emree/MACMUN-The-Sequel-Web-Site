    "content":"The United Nations Security Council is one of the United Nations’ six principal organs and is tasked with ensuring the continuity of international peace and security. The Security Council’s powers are significantly broader when compared to the United Nations General Assembly, including the authorization of peacekeeping missions, the enactment of sanctions against a country, or the authorization of military action. Moreover, the Security Council’s resolutions are binding to all Member States of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter.<br>The Security Council comprises fifteen Member States, five of which are Permanent Members, with the other ten being temporary, and rotating every two years. The five Permanent Members of the Council, possess a veto power, which allows them to override any resolution on the floor, regardless of a vote. The Council’s agendas comprise the many political and military crises worldwide, like those between Russia and Ukraine, or the ones in Cyprus or Ethiopia.<br>If one is interested in the nuances of diplomacy, negotiation, and trying to find a compromise that somewhat pleases all parties, and doesn’t anger them too greatly, the Security Council may be an ideal committee, provided that they are experienced in Model United Nations.<br><br>",

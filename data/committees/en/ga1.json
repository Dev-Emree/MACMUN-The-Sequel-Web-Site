    "content":"Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) is the first committee of the General Assembly that was founded in 1945. <br>In the 1940s disarmament was a big problem because of the spending on the military. Since the first conference of DISEC, there has been a UN sub-organ that aims to reduce military spending and find solutions for the crisis that may affect the international community. DISEC's topics are not only isolated to the military. It also discusses the problems about data and securing the data around the world since it is a material that can be used against users, and governments on the web. Further, militarisation is not limited to our world as well; it can be anywhere that concerns humans. If there are problems with; physical or digital security and disarmament worldwide, DISEC will be the first option to discuss the topic in the General Assembly.<br><br>",

    "content":"The United Nations’ 6th General Assembly committee LEGAL is the primary forum for the debate regarding legal inquiries. In the LEGAL Committee, we will have two agenda items.<br>The first agenda is a very recent and controversial issue of “Legislation of Abortion”. As the news has shown, there is much opposition between not only small groups but also between different countries with their policies being utterly different from one another. Our quest is going to be to come to a concrete conclusion regarding the legalization of this issue.<br>The second agenda is also a very dynamic “Legality and Ethics of Genetic Modifications” question, having caused various controversies amongst diverse groups, institutions, and countries for years. Our responsibility will be to address how legal and ethical it is to do genetic modifications.<br><br>",

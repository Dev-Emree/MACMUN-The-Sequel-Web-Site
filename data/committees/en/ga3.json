    "content":"The third committee of the UN General Assembly known as the Social, Cultural and Humanitarian Committee (SOCHUM) discusses a wide range of issues concerning human rights and social relations. First convened in 1948, it continues to seek the noble cause of protecting the human rights of every single individual and elevating pre-existing programs and agendas in advancing equality all over the world. Thus, it provides a field for honest and productive debate on issues concerning all member states. During MACMUN ‘22, the two SOCHUM committees will entertain the issues of The Establishment of Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners Globally, Lawful Punishment and Criminal Rehabilitation &  Preserving Freedom of Information and Freedom of Expression respectively.<br><br>We often overlook the rights of those we deem outcasts of society, whose actions clash with the interests and rights of others and therefore are incarcerated. One cannot imagine the blatant and cruel human rights violations that occur in penal institutions without adequate research and education. This agenda item explores the appliance and failures of the criminal justice system in upholding rules and procedures from a humanitarian perspective.<br><br>“If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” The pillars of democracy are the liberties of speech and expression. This agenda item highlights the importance of all voices being heard, no matter how insignificant they may seem.<br><br>",

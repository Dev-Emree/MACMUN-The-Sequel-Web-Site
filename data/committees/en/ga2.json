Ever since the committee has been meeting once every single year in October. It mainly focuses on economic development and development with significance to macroeconomics. For this conference, delegates will be dealing with two main agendas. The first one is a major problem every country once faced or still facing: Inflation. Delegates shall work on understanding it and finding possible suitable solutions to it in order for the country that they are representing may have a chance to overcome it. Our second agenda is more of a violation issue: Countering money laundering. For this matter, delegates will be working to prevent money laundering from happening. If you believe you have an interest in these agendas or economics and finance generally,<br>GA-2 ECOFIN will serve you well.<br><br>",

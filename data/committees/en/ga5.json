    "content":"The Administrative and Budget Committee (ADBUG) is the fifth committee of the United Nations General Assembly. It is mainly concerned with Member States' contributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the organization, how Member States' contributions are allocated, the United Nations program and peacekeeping budgets, and human resources issues. It is also responsible for administrative matters such as management reform, governance, oversight, and accountability issues. Finally, it is responsible for reviewing all draft resolutions with budgetary implications before they go to the General Assembly. <br>This year, our committee has two separate agenda items to be evaluated in two separate committees. In the first committee, we will deal with the Financing of United Nations Peacekeeping Operations with a special emphasis on Afghanistan, and in the other committee, we will discuss the Reform and Optimization of the Post-Pandemic United Nations System. In this committee, you can discuss the financial branches in the United Nations, the economic situation of the countries, and their budgets, depending on the subject on the agenda. It is an excellent committee for any delegate with an interest in such matters.<br><br>",

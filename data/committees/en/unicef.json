    "content":"The United Nations General Assembly (UN-GA) established the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund on December 11, 1946, by resolution 57(1), to give food and medical treatment to women and children in post-World War II nations. The mission of UNICEF was expanded in 1950 to include addressing the long-term need of children and women in underdeveloped nations worldwide. The terms \"international\" and \"emergency\" were removed from the organization's name in 1953 when it officially joined the United Nations System, but the abbreviation \"UNICEF\" was kept.<br><br>This year's committee will focus on reducing religious oppression and ensuring religious freedom for children around the world. Unfortunately, even under the conditions of the 21st century, children who are under the pressure of families and society in various parts of the world are forced to live under the conditions of the religion imposed on them and to receive an education as required by this religion. UNICEF's highlight will be providing better conditions for these children.<br><br>",
